* If you haven't already, install dialog in Termux:
```
pkg install dialog
```

* If you haven't already, you need to install netcat to send and receive data over the network:
```
pkg install netcat
```

* Make sure the script is executable:
```
chmod +x command_list.sh
```

## This is an example of what you can do with this. In this example i have made something like a remote bomb, when pinged it will execute malitiouse code to destroy an operating systems infistructure and data (is still being editied)

Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

**Importing modules and installing dependencies**

The script starts by importing various Python modules, including os, socket, ctypes, keyboard, threading, tkinter, and subprocess. It also attempts to install the pywin32 package using pip, which is required for the script to work.

**Defining functions**

The script defines several functions:

* placeholder1(): A placeholder function that prints a message.
* unclosable(): Creates an unclosable window with a warning message using tkinter.
* write_mbr(message): Writes a message to the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the physical drive.
* mbr(): Overwrites the MBR with a message and then shuts down the system.
* mbr_wm(): Overwrites the MBR without a message and then shuts down the system.
* gods_wrath(): Displays a warning message using win32gui and then calls the unclosable() and mbr() functions.
* handle_client(client_socket): Handles incoming connections from a client. It receives commands from the client and executes them.
* main(): Creates a socket server that listens for incoming connections on port 9999.

**Server functionality:**

The script creates a socket server that listens for incoming connections on port 9999. When a client connects, it creates a new thread to handle the client connection. The handle_client() function receives commands from the client and executes them.

**The script supports two commands:**

* ping: The server responds with a countdown from 10 to 1, and then executes the gods_wrath() function, which displays a warning message and overwrites the MBR.
* exit: The server closes the connection.
## Security concerns

This script is a serious security risk, as it:

* Overwrites the MBR, which can render the system unbootable.
* Creates an unclosable window, which can be annoying and disruptive.
* Allows an attacker to remotely control the system.
* Requires administrator privileges to run, which is a significant security risk.

It is not recommended to run this script on a production system or any system that contains sensitive data.
